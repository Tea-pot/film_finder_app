### Film Finder app
This application uses [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) The Open Movie Database.
The project uses Bootstrap and bootstrap theme - [bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) as an UI which can be easyly customised.
The main idea was to build a simple application where you could search for films and store your favourites. It has a link to Youtube.com for trailers and it uses client Local Storage to save your favourite queries.

I hope you will enjoy it.
Best regards,
Ka.
